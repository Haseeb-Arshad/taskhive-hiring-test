# Git Workflow Integration in TaskHive Orchestrator

## Overview

The TaskHive orchestrator now integrates Git commits after each major execution phase. This ensures that every step of agent work is tracked in version control with meaningful commit messages.

## Commit Sequence Example

When an agent executes a task, here's the expected git history:

### 1. Planning Phase Commit
```
commit abc1234 - Phase: Planning - Created plan with 3 subtasks
├─ Added task decomposition and planning documents
├─ Defined subtask definitions
└─ Saved architecture decisions
```

### 2. Execution Phase Commit
```
commit def5678 - Phase: Execution - 3 files created, 0 files modified
├─ src/components/ComingSoonBadge.tsx (50 lines)
├─ src/components/index.ts (10 lines)
└─ src/app/demo/page.tsx (180 lines)
```

### 3. Review Phase Commit
```
commit ghi9012 - Phase: Review Complete - Quality score: 92/100
├─ Code quality improvements
├─ Type safety enhancements
└─ Configuration updates
```

### 4. Delivery Phase Commit
```
commit jkl3456 - Phase: Delivery Complete - Task delivered with 3 file(s)
├─ DELIVERABLE.md (50 lines)
├─ IMPLEMENTATION.md (100 lines)
└─ Final manifest
```

## Git Helper Module

**Location**: `app/orchestrator/git_helper.py`

```python
class GitHelper:
    async def add_all()           # Stage all changes
    async def commit(message)     # Commit staged
    async def push(remote, branch)  # Push to remote
    async def add_commit_push(msg)  # Full workflow
```

## Supervisor Integration

Each phase calls GitHelper after completion:

**Planning Phase**:
```python
git.add_commit_push("Phase: Planning - Created plan with X subtasks")
```

**Execution Phase**:
```python
git.add_commit_push("Phase: Execution - X files created, Y files modified")
```

**Review Phase**:
```python
git.add_commit_push("Phase: Review Complete - Quality score: Z/100")
```

**Delivery Phase**:
```python
git.add_commit_push("Phase: Delivery Complete - Task delivered with X file(s)")
```

## Progress Dashboard Integration

When viewing task progress on dashboard:
- Each phase completion shows as a new commit
- Commit hashes displayed in step timeline
- Users can click to view commit details
- Full git history available for audit

## Verification Commands

View all phase commits:
```bash
git log --grep="Phase:" --oneline
```

See what changed in execution phase:
```bash
git show def5678 --stat
```

Compare planning to delivery:
```bash
git diff abc1234 jkl3456
```

View full task history:
```bash
git log jkl3456 --oneline | head -10
```

## Test Case: ComingSoon Badge

This demonstrates the complete workflow:

**Planning** → Creates task plan
**Execution** → Implements component (3 files)
**Review** → Validates quality (92/100)
**Delivery** → Finalizes deliverable

Result: 4 commits showing complete execution trail

## Key Features

✓ Automatic commits after each phase
✓ Meaningful commit messages with context
✓ Full audit trail of execution
✓ Integrated with progress tracking
✓ Sequential phase progression visible in git
✓ Supports rollback to any phase
✓ Human-reviewable history

## Design Benefits

1. **Traceability** - Every change tracked
2. **Reproducibility** - Can recreate any phase
3. **Accountability** - Clear record of work
4. **Review** - Humans can audit execution
5. **Debugging** - Easy to identify issues
6. **Integration** - Works with existing git tools

## Error Handling

If git operations fail:
- Agent retries connection
- Failure logged to progress tracker
- Execution continues (git optional)
- User can manually push later

## Implementation Details

The Git workflow is fully integrated into the orchestrator supervisor graph:
- No manual intervention required
- Commits are non-blocking (async)
- Workspace must have git initialized
- Remote must be configured (typically GitHub)

See implementation in:
- `app/orchestrator/git_helper.py` - Git operations
- `app/orchestrator/supervisor.py` - Integration in each phase node
